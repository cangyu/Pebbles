# Pebbles
Some interesting knickknacks.

## simple-matrix
A C++ based matrix class that supports basic operations like +,=,+=,==,<<,>>,m(i,j) and m[i][j].  
Considerations of const are included.

## simple-SVG-library
A C++ based SVG library for elementary graphic operation, which implements the classes of container, root, rectangle, circle, ellipse, path, and some styles.

## F4
4 basic data structures: BST, AVL, Disjoint Set, Graph.  
___BST___: 3 ways to traverse a binary tree were introduced;  
___AVL___: A simple implementation of the AVL balance tree with detailed explanation.  
___Disjoint Set___: We take negative nums for accumulation.  
___Graph___: Most classical algorithms related to graph were implemented.

## cdecl
C declaration interpreter. Both recursive and iterative methods are implemented.  
The iterative method is based on the idea of ___FSM___, which reveals the essence of computation.
